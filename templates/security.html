            <h1>Security Measures for Operational Technology</h1>
            <p>Ensuring the security of Operational Technology (OT) systems is a complex task that requires a multi-layered approach. This page outlines best practices, tools, and techniques for addressing the unique security challenges associated with OT systems.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Risk Assessment and Management</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>Effective OT security begins with a comprehensive risk assessment and management strategy. Organizations must first understand the landscape of their OT environments by conducting thorough risk assessments and maintaining an exhaustive inventory of all assets. This allows for the identification of critical systems and the evaluation of potential vulnerabilities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly update risk assessments to address new threats and system changes.</li>
                <li>Implement a risk management framework to monitor and mitigate identified risks.</li>
                <li>Conduct penetration testing to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Network Segmentation and Access Control -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Network Segmentation and Access Control</h2>
            <p>Network segmentation is one of the most effective strategies for securing OT environments. By dividing the OT network into isolated segments, organizations can limit the spread of malware or other cyber threats if a breach occurs. This approach is particularly crucial for protecting critical systems and ensuring that attackers cannot easily move laterally within the network.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use multi-factor authentication to secure access to OT systems.</li>
                <li>Enforce strict access control policies, including role-based access controls (RBAC).</li>
                <li>Monitor network traffic for unusual activity that could indicate an attack.</li>
                <li>Regularly review and update access privileges to ensure they align with current roles and responsibilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Incident Response and Business Continuity Planning -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Incident Response and Business Continuity Planning</h2>
            <!-- Image representing emergency response -->

                <img src="../static/img/fema_truck.jpg" alt="FEMA truck in emergency response" class="responsive-img">
                <figcaption>FEMA truck as part of an emergency response, illustrating the importance of planning for continuity in crises.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>No OT system is completely immune to cyber threats, making it essential to have a robust incident response and business continuity plan in place. Organizations must be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents to minimize damage and ensure that critical operations can continue. This includes having a well-trained incident response team and clear procedures for managing incidents.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop an incident response plan tailored to the specific needs of your OT environment.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular incident response drills to keep the team prepared for real threats.</li>
                <li>Ensure that your business continuity plan includes contingencies for prolonged outages or significant breaches.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Emerging Technologies and Future Trends -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Emerging Technologies and Future Trends</h2>
            <p>As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, emerging technologies are playing an increasingly important role in enhancing OT security. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, for instance, are being integrated into OT security frameworks to analyze vast amounts of data in real-time and predict potential threats. This shift towards more proactive security measures represents a significant advancement in OT security strategies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leverage AI and machine learning for threat detection and response.</li>
                <li>Adopt zero-trust architectures to reduce the risk of insider threats.</li>
                <li>Explore the use of advanced encryption techniques to protect data at rest and in transit.</li>
                <li>Stay informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity and adjust your strategies accordingly.</li>
